            He was born on April 26, 1932 in Hisar (a district of East Punjab, now a part of Haryana) in India. He graduated from Lahore in 1954 and later received his Master's degree in Islamic Studies from the University of Karachi in 1965 While still a student and an activist of the Islami Jami`yat-e-Talaba, he became a Mudarris (or teacher) of the Qur'an. Even after resigning from Jama`at, he continued to give Quranic lectures in different cities of Pakistan, and especially after 1965 spent a great deal of time studying the Quran. He also worked with the tablighi jamaat but then left the organization due to some methodological differences.

            In the context of Qur'anic exegesis and understanding, Ahmed was a firm traditionalist of the genre of Maulana Mehmood Hassan Deobandi and Allama Shabbir Ahmad Usmani; yet he presented Qur'anic teachings in a scientific and enlightened way. 
            Dr. Israr Ahmed believed in what he called “Islamic revolutionary thought,” which consists of the idea that Islam -- " the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah must be implemented in the social, cultural, juristic, political, and economic spheres of life." In this he is said to follow Mohammad Rafiuddin and Muhammad Iqbal.
